This project defines an Automation System for a smart home, which includes smart lights, a thermostat, and a security camera.
The key components and functionalities are:
SmartLight can turn on/off, adjust brightness, and dim gradually, with a randomized state change feature.
Thermostat controls temperature, supports gradual temperature adjustments, and can toggle its state randomly.
SecurityCamera detects motion and changes its security status, with states like "Idle," "Alert," and "Recording."
AutomationSystem manages devices, runs a simulation, and logs actions across multiple iterations.
The run_simulation method randomly detects motion, alters device states, and adjusts lights automatically to simulate dynamic home automation.
